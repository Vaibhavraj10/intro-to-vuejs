# intro-to-vuejs
This is a short introductory book to teach the fundamentals of VueJS (http://vuejs.org)

## What is VueJS

VueJS is a progressive framework to build dynamic apps. It is the View layer in the traditional MVC framework. Along with supporting libraries, Vue can be used to write Single Page Apps which are dynamic websites where page refresh is not required. 
Refer the [official docs](http://vuejs.org) for more details.

## Why this book?

While learning Vue, I was a total newbie to front end development. This is the book I wish existed when I was learning front end dev with Vue. A book which teaches _how to apply_ the knowledge. Read the [wiki](http://github.com/thewhitetulip/intro-to-vuejs/wiki) for more details.

# intro-to-vuejs
This is a short introductory book to teach the fundamentals of VueJS (http://vuejs.org)

## What is VueJS

VueJS is a progressive framework to build dynamic apps. It is the View layer in the traditional MVC framework. Along with supporting libraries, Vue can be used to write Single Page Apps which are dynamic websites where page refresh is not required. 

Vue is simple to use and supports Web Components.

## Why this book?

While learning Vue, I was a total newbie to front end development. The official guide at http://vuejs.org/v2/guide/ assumes. I tried submitting a [https://github.com/vuejs/vuejs.org/pull/591](PR) to add a verbose getting started example, but it got rejected because. 

> you don't really need <html>, <head> or <body> if you are running the example code in a decently up-to-date browser

This aims to be a book which teaches by example.

## Contributing

Please raise an issue regarding the contribution you wish to make. Once that is decided you can start working on the change if it is a big one, otherwise just send a PR.

This is a contributor friendly project and won't reject a PR unless there is really a valid reason.
